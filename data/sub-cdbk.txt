           Note that White does not include those who said they were Hispanic.
           And Hispanic does not include those who said they were black.

           Since GSS did not ask about Hispanic identification before the
           2000 survey, this variable only has valid codes from 2000 and later.
           Pre-2000 respondents are coded 9, which is defined as missing data.

           capital letters. For example, if the word in capital letters is
           BEAST, you would say "4" since "animal" come closer to BEAST
           than any of the other words. If you wish, I will read the words
           to you. These words are difficult for almost everyone just give
           me your best guess if you are not sure of the answer.
